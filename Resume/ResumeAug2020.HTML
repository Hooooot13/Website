      <p> The first silence is described as a hollow or echoing quiet, made by things that were lacking. Elements include the lack of wind which would have stirred noise from a creaking sign, the lack of a crowd who would fill the silence with conversation or the lack of horses stabled in the barn. If any of these things had been present and made a noise they would have filled or chased the silence away. The first part is always concluded with "If there had been music… but no, of course there was no music. In fact there were none of these things, and so the silence remained." </p>
